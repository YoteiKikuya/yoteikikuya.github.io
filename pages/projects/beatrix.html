    This project focuses on redesigning Beatrix, Queen of Remnants, a character I 
  initially created in 2019. The final outcome is a cohesive design sheet that 
  reflects her evolved narrative role as a capable leader and protector, 
  blending regality and ruggedness. <br><br>  The redesign was a personal project, 
  aimed at enhancing my skills in character design and iterative workflows. 
  The project spanned a week in the summer of 2024, with Krita as my application 
  of choice. My roles included sketching, iteration, and refinement of Beatrixâ€™s 
  design, focusing on silhouette exploration, prop design, and narrative 
  alignment. <br><br> The objective was to redesign Beatrix to align her appearance 
  with her narrative role. Her original design no longer reflected her story, 
  creating a disconnect between her visual identity and character traits. This 
  redesign aimed to bridge that gap, emphasizing her qualities as a leader and 
  protector. <br><br> The process began by identifying non-negotiable design 
  elements: a prosthetic arm, a dark complexion, and dual-wielded weapons. I 
  explored 21 iterations in total, experimenting with silhouettes, climates, and 
  aesthetics to push creative boundaries. After selecting iteration 5B as the 
  foundation, I refined the design by integrating features from other iterations
  , such as hairstyle 2C and prosthetic arm components from versions F and H. 
  Props were carefully designed to enhance cohesion and add visual intrigue. 
  The final design achieves a balance of practicality and narrative alignment, 
  while maintaining aesthetic appeal. <br><br>  As the sole creative lead on this 
  project, I gained a deeper appreciation for the iterative design process and 
  the importance of self-evaluation. Working independently allowed me to refine 
  my ability to assess design choices critically and adapt them to achieve a 
  cohesive result. However, I recognize the value of incorporating feedback and 
  working within client requirements to align creative outcomes with specific 
  needs. Moving forward, I aim to engage in projects that emphasize collaboration, 
  feedback loops, and client-driven goals to expand my versatility as a designer 
  and improve my ability to meet diverse expectations. <br><br>
