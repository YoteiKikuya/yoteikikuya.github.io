  December 22, 2024 <br><br>
    In order to hone my critical eye and iterative skills, I tasked myself with redesigning an original character.
    My initial version of Beatrix, Queen of Remnants was conceived in 2019 and remained relatively unchanged, but narrative
    developments required a complete design overhaul. I aimed to design a character that gives the impression of a capable leader and protector, 
  blending regality, ruggedness, and a sense of spiritual leadership. The end result is a cohesive turnaround sheet that accurately represents Beatrix's traits
  according to the creative vision, as well as detailed sketches of key props.<br><br> 
  The project spanned a week in the summer of 2024, with Krita as my application 
  of choice. My tasks consisted of sketching, iteration, and refinement of Beatrixâ€™s 
  design, focusing on silhouette exploration, prop design, and narrative 
  alignment. <br><br> The process began by identifying non-negotiable design 
  elements: a prosthetic arm, a dark complexion, and a dual wielded staff and sword with a serpentine motif. I 
  explored 21 iterations in total, experimenting with silhouettes, climates, and 
  aesthetics to push creative boundaries. After selecting iteration 5B as the 
  foundation, I refined the design by integrating features from other iterations, 
  such as hairstyle 2C and prosthetic arm components from versions F and H. 
  Props were designed with a balance of cohesion and visual intrigue in mind. In retrospect, I would have benefited from honing in on specific details such as
  material textures and the relationships between components for this sheet to serve as a more workable base. More up-to-date showcases of my progress in this area
  can be found in the Projects > Digital Renders page on my site.
 <br><br>  As the sole creative lead on this project, I was able to work on the iteration process and 
  my self-evaluation skills. Working independently allowed me to refine 
  my ability to assess design choices critically and adapt them to achieve a 
  cohesive result. Going forward, I aim to attach myself to more client-driven projects, to familiarize
  myself with feedback loops and revision to meet the needs of someone else. <br><br>
