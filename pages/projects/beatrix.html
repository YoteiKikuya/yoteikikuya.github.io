    In order to hone my critical eye and iterative skills, I tasked myself with redesigning an original character.
    My initial version of Beatrix, Queen of Remnants was conceived in 2019 and remained relatively unchanged, but narrative
    developments required a complete design overhaul. I aimed to design a character that gives the impression of a capable leader and protector, 
  blending regality, ruggedness, and a sense of spiritual leadership. The end result is a cohesive turnaround sheet that accurately represents Beatrix's traits
  according to the creative vision, as well as detailed sketches of key props.<br>
  
  <br> 
  The project spanned a week in the summer of 2024, with Krita as my application 
  of choice. My tasks consisted of sketching, iteration, and refinement of Beatrix’s 
  design, focusing on silhouette exploration, prop design, and narrative alignment.

  The process began by identifying non-negotiable design 
  elements: a prosthetic arm, a dark complexion, and a dual wielded staff and sword with a serpentine motif. I 
  explored 21 iterations in total, experimenting with silhouettes, climates, and 
  aesthetics to push creative boundaries. After selecting iteration 5B as the 
  foundation, I refined the design by integrating features from other iterations, 
  such as hairstyle 2C and prosthetic arm components from versions F and H. 
  Props were designed with a balance of cohesion and visual intrigue in mind. In retrospect, I would have benefited from honing in on specific details such as
  material textures and the relationships between components for this sheet to serve as a more workable base. More up-to-date showcases of my progress in this area
  can be found in the Projects > Digital Renders page on my site.

  As this was a solo project, I was able to work on the iteration process and 
  my self-evaluation skills. Working independently allowed me to refine 
  my ability to assess design choices critically and adapt them to achieve a 
  cohesive result. Going forward, I aim to attach myself to more client-driven projects, to familiarize
  myself with feedback loops and revision to meet the needs of someone else. <br><br>
