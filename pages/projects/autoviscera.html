    Animated Short

  <p class="body-text">
    An ancient automaton’s scanners boot up for the first 
    time in uncounted centuries. It projects the discovery 
    of something remarkable: Purely biological life, able to 
    exist independently of machinery. Witnessing this 
    discovery is a Courier, a meek machine designed to 
    transport lifeforce across battlefields and be consumed 
    by the recipient. For the first time since the Great 
    Feasting, it forms a goal independent of its function. 
    In order to witness this life, it must trek across the 
    wasteland between the citadel and outer wall, where 
    machines wage perpetual war, long having outlived their 
    original purpose. Upon reaching the Citadel, the danger 
    doesn’t end. The Courier must navigate infrastructure 
    never designed to be navigated, addicts who capture 
    Couriers to siphon their energy to feel more alive than 
    the living, and mad guards that crave violence to retain 
    semblance of duty.
    <br><br>
    In the end, the Courier reaches its destination, beaten 
    down and exhausted by its journey. It collapses, content 
    to fade in lush moss in place of scorched bedrock. As 
    its vessel fails, its remaining lifeforce leaks out into 
    the soil, planting the seed for a brighter future.
