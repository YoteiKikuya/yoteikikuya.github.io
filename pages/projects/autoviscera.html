      The Art of Manmade Horrors
        </p>
      <p class="body-text"style="margin:0px;font-size:1vw;">
      Early on, we collectively decided on a framework of a journey through various, distinct set pieces, focusing on scale contrast and the sense of a world larger than the story. As this was our first time with 3D animation, I aimed for a visual language that would be easy to pick up and optimize. I settled on a dark, biomechanical look for the characters due to overlapping interests of teammates, and as at the time, animation seemed more straightforward if they are largely made up of inflexible pieces. 
      This design style also lent itself to the second optimization strategy, which was darkness and fog. In my early sketches, I framed compositions and character designs with careful consideration to silhouettes, clear motion and mood instead of focusing on minute details.
        </p>
      <p class="body-text"style="margin:0px;font-size:1vw;color:orangered;font-weight:bold"><br>
      The Courier: Built For a Bygone World
        </p>
      <p class="body-text"style="margin:0px;font-size:1vw;">
      I designed the protagonist, the Courier, to serve as a point of contrast with the world around it. I made this choice over a more traditionally “cool” protagonist, largely to create empathy for the Courier’s struggle and to emphasize the intimidating nature of the other characters. The first of these, the Soldier, is based on the initial idea I had for the Courier.
        </p>
      <p class="body-text"style="margin:0px;font-size:1vw;color:orangered;font-weight:bold"><br>
      Lonely Machines of War
        </p>
      <p class="body-text"style="margin:0px;font-size:1vw;">
      The antagonists were designed to be hostile and imposing without going as far into outright violent designs, reflecting the purposes they’ve carved beyond their initial functionality. I modelled the soldier and bird myself, while providing concept art for team members to handle other characters.   
        </p>
      <p class="body-text"style="margin:0px;font-size:1vw;color:orangered;font-weight:bold"><br>
      Overseer
    <br> </p>   
      <p class="body-text"style="margin:0px;font-size:1vw;">
      The separation of locations between scenes was intended largely for efficiency and ease of remote collaboration. I worked on the bird chase scene and the laser cannon, while monitoring progress on other scenes. When teammates needed clarification on direction for environment and character positions and lighting, I provided supplementary sketches and photo references. Additionally, I provided feedback on pacing, I started video calls to walk through where camera cuts should be made.  
    </p>
      <p class="body-text"style="margin:0px;font-size:1vw;color:orangered;font-weight:bold"><br>
      The Skyline Chase
    </p>
      <p class="body-text"style="margin:0px;font-size:1vw;">
      When animating this scene, my main point of reference was the famous scene in Alfred Hitchock’s North by Northwest (1959). Due to the bird’s weapon of choice being the machineguns on its sides, looking at footage of planes was the most logical, with bird-like movements and characterization added after the core movements. I realized, however, that it was more effective if it behaved predictably how a bird would at first, then gradually show more of its tricks. I took advantage of its mechanical nature when it turned after the initial swoop, with its segments all rotating in a slightly out of sync chain starting from the head. I followed this up with the reveal of the machineguns to ramp up the threat factor and force the Courier deeper into the city.

    <p class="body-text"style="margin:0px;font-size:1vw;color:orangered;font-weight:bold"><br>
      Autoviscera
</p>
    <p class="body-text"style="margin:0px;font-size:1vw;">
      I made a new word for this project, which became the main motif for the story I aimed to tell. If I were to define Autoviscera, it would be a self-perpetuating system of violence. The characters are all bound to this concept, waging war and predation as a means of seeking purpose where there is none. I wanted the logo to reflect this nihilism and brutality, so I opted for an aggressive but archaic looking Goudy Old Style SH font, and overlaid high photos of gears and cables. These elements together give the image of a weathered, ancient machine still chugging along. Then, I added the spikes and hanging cables to mimic the Citadel, cementing this logo as a representation of this world as opposed to a vaguely mechanical styling.
