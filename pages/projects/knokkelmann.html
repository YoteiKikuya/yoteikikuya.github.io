	For my final project for my IAT 167: Digital Games course, I developed 
  Knokkelmann (Bone Man), a top-down shooter game inspired by metal music and 
  Nordic folklore. This project has two versions, the first being a prototype 
  that aimed to showcase the functionality of the basic mechanics, but lacking 
  much distinction or visual assets. The second, final version includes more 
  enemy variety, the powerup mechanic, a more compelling projectile system, 
  menus and an aesthetic theme.

  <p class="body-text">As per the course’s requirements, I programmed Knokkelmann in Java, using the 
  Processing program and its built-in functionality. To create the sprites, I 
  hand-drew them on Krita at the resolution I intended for the final product, to 
  avoid problems with scaling. I had three weeks to go from conception to launch. 
  I spent the first week developing the prototype, then the following two 
  solidifying a theme and developing on the foundation I had built. There were 
  basic game and code requirements for full marks, such as three distinct enemies, 
  a powerup system and the main menu and game over screens. Additionally, there 
  were bonus marks awarded to extra mechanics and functionality.  To accomplish 
  this, I modified the boss enemy (Bjergtrolde)’s behaviour for distinct movement 
  patterns and modified the player’s thrown projectiles into a more unique 
  boomerang that could be used more strageically than the standard bullet. 
  Additionally, I implemented a difficulty scaling of sorts, where more challenging 
  enemies would begin appearing after the player reached a certain number of points. </p>

  <p class="body-text">Seeing as I worked on this project solo, I had to budget my time to create a 
  product that fulfilled the requirements, not necessarily the result I would 
  have preferred. This mainly reflects the visual side, as I did not have time 
  to make animations for character actions. Implementing this would have not only 
  have served for aesthetic appeal, but also for more intuitive gameplay in regard 
  to making it clear when the player or an enemy was hit. Despite this, my 
  instructor was satisfied by the result, and I completed the project with a 94/100. 
  With this in mind, I will prioritize the demands of the client before my own 
  feelings in future projects, and make sure those are all met in a timely matter 
  before exploring and discussing areas for further improvement.</p>
